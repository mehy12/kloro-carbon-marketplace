## Important: One Private Key Works for All Networks! 🎉

Your MetaMask private key is the same for:
- ✅ Ethereum (ETH)
- ✅ Base Sepolia
- ✅ Polygon Amoy
- ✅ All EVM-compatible chains

You only need to export it once!

## How to Export Your Private Key

### Step 1: Open MetaMask
- Click the MetaMask extension icon in your browser

### Step 2: Select the Account
- Make sure you're on the account you want to use
- (Tip: Consider using a separate account just for testing)

### Step 3: Access Account Details
1. Click the **three dots (⋮)** next to your account name
2. Select **"Account details"**

### Step 4: Show Private Key
1. Click **"Show private key"**
2. Enter your MetaMask password
3. Click **"Confirm"**

### Step 5: Copy the Private Key
1. Click **"Hold to reveal Private Key"** and hold the button
2. The private key will appear (64 hex characters)
3. Click the **copy icon** to copy it
4. **Important**: It will look like: `a1b2c3d4e5f6...` (64 characters, no 0x prefix in MetaMask)

## Next Step: Add to .env File

Once you have your private key copied, I'll help you add it to your `.env` file securely.

## Security Reminders

⚠️ **Never share your private key with anyone**
⚠️ **Don't paste it in chat or messages**
⚠️ **Only add it to your local `.env` file**
⚠️ **The `.env` file is gitignored - it won't be committed**
